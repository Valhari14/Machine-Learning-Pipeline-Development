# **Automated Machine Learning Pipeline Development**

## **Project Overview**

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of a Bachelor‚Äôs thesis project focused on the **design and development of an automated machine learning pipeline**. The objective is to streamline the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning (ML) models‚Äîcovering data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment‚Äîthrough a user-friendly, no-code interface. The system integrates key principles from **AutoML**, **MLOps**, and **explainable AI**, and has been built with modularity and scalability in mind to suit both academic research and real-world applications.
